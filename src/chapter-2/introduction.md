# Introduction

- *Physical models* consider the types of computers and devices that
constitute a system and their interconnectivity *without* details of
specific technologies.
- *Architectural models* describe a system in terms of the computational
  and communication tasks performed by its computational elements.
- *Fundamental models* take an abstract perspective in order to describe
  solutions to individual issues faced by most distributed systems.

Because different computers share no global time, all communication
between processes is achieved by message-passing.

- The *interaction* model deals with performance and the difficulty of
  setting time limits in a distributed system.
- The *failure* model attempts to give a precise specification of faults
  that can be exhibited by processes and channels.
- The *security* model discusses the possible threats to processes and
  communication channels.
