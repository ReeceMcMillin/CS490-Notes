# Examples of Distributed Systems

## Web Search
Google has put significant effort into distributed system design through
things like:
    - distributed physical infrastructure
    - distributed file systems
    - distributed *storage* systems
    - distributed lock service
    - programming model that supports parallel/distributed computations
## MMORPGs
Online games rely on distributed systems for reasons such as:
    - players require fast response times
    - events must propagate in real time to many players
## Financial Trading
The financial industry has long been at the cutting edge of distributed
systems technology. Emphasis is on the communication and processing of
*events* with a focus on reliability and efficiency across a large
number of clients. These systems are known as *distributed event
systems* and are covered more in [Chapter 6](../chapter-6/index.md).
